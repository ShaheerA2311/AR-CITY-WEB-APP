# AR-CITY-WEB-APP#

##An OpenARCloud-based system to accurately and remotely place objects to previously scanned reconstructions##

####Previously, reconstructions produced by OpenARCloud's AC-Scanner app, required the AC-Objects app to manually be within a location and place a sticker to that location. Now, with our new system, users are able to post sticker remotely to a previously scanned reconstruction, without needing to be anywhere near the post location, as long as an initial object has been placed in the reconstruction before.####

To get started, and use our web app, please follow the steps below:

1. Our system integrates the Google Maps API to calculate our location data. To use this API, head to the [Named Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/google/maps-apis/credentials "Google Maps Platform Credentials page")
